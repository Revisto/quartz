## Here is My Journey Through Development and Music Production and Other Stuff 🚀🎶

Hi! I'm Alireza Shabani also known as Revisto. I'm a developer and music producer with a passion for creating things and lots of other stuff (really). I'm currently working on a few projects, including a music EP and a few bots and apps. I'm also learning a lot of [new things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dJF8d73W_c). I'm excited to share my journey here, so stay tuned! 🎉

### About Me 🧑‍💻🎵🐧🎮📺📚

- **Developer**: I'm a full-stack developer with experience in Python, Flask, Django, Docker, and more. I'm currently working on a few projects that are open-source, so check them out on my [GitHub](https://github.com/revisto). 💻🐍🌐🐳

- **Music Producer**: I've been producing music for almost a year now, and I'm currently working on my third EP. I'm also learning a lot about music theory, so I'm excited to share my progress with you. You can listen to my music on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/theRevisto). 🎵🎹🎶

- **Linux Enthusiast**: I've been using Linux for years now, and I love it. I've recently switched from Pop!_OS to Fedora, and I'm loving it so far. 🐧🖥️

- **Gamer (kind of)**: I play games occasionally, but I'm not a hardcore gamer. I mostly play Minecraft and a few other games. 🎮🕹️

- **Series Lover**: I love watching series and movies. I'm currently watching The Walking Dead. My favorite series of all time is House M.D, Dexter, Rick and Morty, and Silicon Valley. 📺🎬

- **Learner**: I'm currently learning a lot of new things, including music production, algorithms, Godot (open-source game engine), and more. 📚🎵🎮
